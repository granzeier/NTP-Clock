# NTP-Clock
Always Correct Alarm Clock

This is for an entry in the Arduino Uno WiFi XMAS Contest 2015

My idea is to use an Arduino Uno, with a ESP8266 Wireless Module, to build an alarm clock.  This clock will periodically send out an NTP (Network Time Protocol) request and update its internal clock.  This way, the clock will never need to be adjusted for Daylight Savings, or for clock frequency drift.
